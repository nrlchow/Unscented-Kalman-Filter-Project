# Unscented Kalman Filter Project

In this project,I built an Unscented Kalman Filter using the CTRV motion model.The data for Radar and Lidar was provided by Mercedes Benz. 
My algorithm ran against laser and radar data.The algorithm output the positions and by comparing them to ground truth data,the following RMSE were obtained from the first dataset -

Accuracy - RMSE:
0.0831692
0.0884681
0.599985
0.58516


For the second dataset -

Accuracy - RMSE:
0.192962
0.190168
0.307838
0.480841
